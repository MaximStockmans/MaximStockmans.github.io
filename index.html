        <p>
            Hello! Nestled in the vibrant heart of Sint-Niklaas, Belgium, I'm continually navigating the dynamic world of technology. As I delve deeper into my studies in Computer Science Engineering at Ghent University, my passion for coding and analytical problem-solving keeps blossoming, shaping me into a skilled architect of the digital realm.
            <br />
            <br />
            In parallel, I flourish as a freelance software engineer, where I immerse myself in pioneering projects and guide spirited teams towards success. My affinity for software architecture allows me to create innovative solutions, transforming mere concepts into impactful applications that push the boundaries of what's possible in the tech industry.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beyond the digital sphere, I am a keen traveller, constantly seeking new adventures that broaden my horizons and deepen my appreciation for diverse cultures and viewpoints. In moments of respite, I unwind with the soothing strums of my ukulele, a practice that nourishes my creative spirit and keeps my passion for technology burning bright.

                        Embarking on a solo venture, I identified a prevalent issue in the tech industry - the tedious and repetitive nature of creating REST APIs. With the aim to revolutionize this process, I initiated a project where I single-handedly wore many hats: from conducting market research to validating the concept in the industry landscape.
                        <br />

                        Currently hosted on <a href="https://restacked.io">restacked.io</a>, the tool is at its MVP stage, demonstrating its potential to significantly streamline the API development process. Through a user-centric web UI, users can define endpoints and set up authentication schemes, after which the tool takes over, automating the generation and deployment of a fully functional API. This initiative not only stands as a testament to my proficiency in coding and software architectural design but also highlights my ability to lead and manage a project from the ground up, steering it towards filling a significant gap in the market.

                        This full-stack application served as a personalized travel planner for budget-conscious travelers looking to explore Europe. Utilizing data from various sources to find the cheapest flights available, the app allowed users to set parameters such as the number of countries to visit and the duration of stay in each, to craft the most cost-effective European trip possible, culminating in a return to the starting destination. I implemented an account system to personalize user experiences further.
